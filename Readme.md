# Collaborative Task Management Application

## Overview

In the realm of task management, efficient collaboration between users is essential for optimizing productivity and achieving objectives. This project, framed within the course on Fundamentals of Parallel and Distributed Computing, aims to develop an innovative web application that facilitates collaborative task management. It not only provides a platform for efficient task management but also serves as a case study to understand the fundamental principles of distributed computing and modern software development methodologies.

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a robust and scalable web application that allows users to manage their tasks collaboratively and efficiently. This will be achieved through a series of specific objectives, from understanding the current state of existing solutions to the implementation and validation of the proposed system.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Angular**: A web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It is used to build the frontend of the application, providing a robust set of tools to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Angular offers features such as two-way data binding, dependency injection, and event handling, facilitating the development of complex and scalable web applications.

### Backend
- **Java with Spring Boot**: Java is a widely-used programming language for enterprise applications due to its portability, robustness, and security. Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies the configuration and development by providing a ready-to-use structure and a set of libraries for web application development. It will be used to build the backend, managing business logic, user authentication, and task management.

### Database
- **Supabase**: A comprehensive cloud solution for database management and user authentication. Supabase provides an easy-to-use platform allowing the development team to focus on application development without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

### Operating System
- **Windows**: The primary operating system for development and deployment, providing a robust and widely-used environment with tools and resources to develop, test, and run the application efficiently.

### Testing
- **JUnit and Mockito**: Tools for unit testing in the backend.
- **Postman or RestAssured**: Tools for integration testing of RESTful services.
- **Jasmine and Karma**: Tools for unit testing JavaScript and Angular in the frontend.

### Version Control
- **Git**: A version control system widely used to facilitate collaborative work and track changes in the application's source code.

### Agile Methodology
- **Scrum**: An agile project management approach focusing on collaboration, adaptability, and incremental delivery of high-quality products. Scrum involves iterative development cycles known as Sprints, promoting transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

## Legal Framework

- **Data Protection**: Compliance with Colombia's Law 1581 of 2012 and Decree 1377 of 2013, regulating personal data protection.
- **E-commerce**: Adherence to Law 527 of 1999, which regulates electronic commerce, including electronic signatures and consumer protection.
- **Intellectual Property**: Observance of Law 23 of 1982 and its amendments, protecting original content such as texts, images, videos, and graphic designs.
- **Consumer Protection**: Compliance with Law 1480 of 2011, known as the Consumer Statute, which establishes consumer rights and supplier obligations.
- **Health and Safety**: Adherence to relevant regulations regarding health and safety in the work environment.

## Data Description

- **User Information**: Basic data such as names, email addresses, roles within the team, and account configuration preferences.
- **Tasks and Projects**: Detailed information on current tasks and projects, including titles, descriptions, due dates, priorities, responsibility assignments, and categorization tags.
- **Activity History**: Records of user actions such as task creation, editing, deletion, comments added, task status changes, and timestamps.
- **Communications**: Data related to team communication, such as chat messages, task comments, update notifications, and real-time interaction logs.
- **Progress Tracking**: Information on task and project progress, including completion percentages, milestones, start and end dates, and progress tracking charts.
- **Performance Data**: Metrics on team performance, such as time spent on tasks, deadline adherence, task distribution efficiency, and collaboration quality.
- **Application Usage Data**: Information on user interaction with the application, such as login frequency, platform engagement time, most used features, and areas of interest.
- **Integration Data**: Data related to integration with other tools or services (e.g., calendars, cloud storage), facilitating synchronization and information flow between different platforms.
